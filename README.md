Entropy visualisation, bi-modal entropy integration, bi-modal entropy prediction of cognitive/perceptual
constructs, and audio-visual/early and late noise entropy prediction all in R. Data has been simulated for the sake of exemplifying, therefore may not be indicative 
of actual data. Many of the methods (to my knowledge) have not been tested, unless indicated by a reference.
Therefore, some methods should be used cautiously.
